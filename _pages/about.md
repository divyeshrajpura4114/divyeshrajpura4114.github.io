My area of research is Automatic Speaker Recognition (ASR) and Speaker Diarization. Recent technological advancement of Smart Devices and Voice Assistants has motivated researchers to develop a robust ASR system in adverse conditions such as noisy environment, far-field, short-duration. The key objective of my research is to develop statistical methods and machine learning-based solutions to solve this challenging problem.
